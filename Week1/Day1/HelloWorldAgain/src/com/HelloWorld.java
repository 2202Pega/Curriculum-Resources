 * Hello!
 * 
 * Java is a Strongly typed, compiled, OOP, general purpose programming language.
	Java is used in enterprise settings, as a backend for 
		full stack server applications.
	Java has useful features such as Garbage Collection, JVM (WORA), Open source, 
		supported by Oracle and its a popular language, so it has a lot, LOT 
		of frameworks and libraries

		 * What is the JDK, JRE, JVM? 
		 * 
		 * JDK: Java Development Kit
		 * 		Is designed to compile and run Java Code/Applications. 
		 * 		It is designed for developers to be able to create 
		 * 			Java Applications. 
		 * 		
		 *  	JDK contains the JRE (JRE is necessary for running code)
		 * 		JDK comes with a lot of useful tools, such as the compiler!
		 * 
		 * JRE: Java Runtime Environment
		 * 		JRE is what we need to run our Java applications. 
		 * 		(WE can't build Java app with just the JRE, but we can run it)
		 * 		ANYONE that doesn't need to code. 
		 * 		With the JRE, I can run any compiled (bytecode) applications. 
		 * 
		 * 		JRE contains core system libraries 
		 * 		JRE contains the JVM!
		 * 
		 * JVM: Java Virtual Machine
		 * 	
		 * 		JVM is what allows us to have WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)
		 * 		JVM will translate bytecode into machine specific code!
		 * 		The JVM is very lightweight and can be run on most systems.
